# ü©∫ Diagno: Medical Symptom Diagnostic Chatbot


## üß† Overview
Diagno is an advanced machine learning model designed to analyze user-inputted symptoms in natural language (RNN) and predict the top 4 potential diseases based on the similarity. 

## üöÄ Features
- Natural Language Input ‚Äì Accepts free-text symptom descriptions.
- Top 4 Disease Predictions ‚Äì Ranked by relevance percentages.
- Comprehensive Output ‚Äì Provides a general description, symptom list, and treatment info for each disease.
- Similarity Scoring ‚Äì Percentage scores for how closely symptoms match each predicted disease.
 
## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- The user enters their symptoms as text.
- Diagno processes the input using natural language processing techniques to extract and interpret symptoms.
- The model use RNN to matches the extracted symptoms against a trained disease database.
- Diagno returns the top 4 potential diseases and their corresponding similarity percentages.
- Diagno also show the general descriptions, symptom, and treatment for each disease.


## üíæ Datasets & Models
Due to GitHub‚Äôs file size limits, large files are hosted on Google Drive:

## üíª How to Run the UI

Follow the steps below to run the Medical Symptom Diagnostic Chatbot UI:

### 1. Download the Project Files
Download all the source code files and place them in a single folder.

### 2. Download the Datasets
Download the required datasets from the provided [Google Drive link]([#datasets--models]) and place them in the appropriate directory.

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code (or any terminal of your choice) and navigate to the project folder using the following command:
```bash 
cd /path/to/your/Medical-Symptom-Diagnostic-Chatbot-main
```

> üìù Note: Replace `/path/to/your/Medical-Symptom-Diagnostic-Chatbot-main` with the actual path to the project directory on your computer.

### 4. Install Dependencies
   Install all the prerequisites and dependencies.

### 5. Run the Application
To start the chatbot UI, run main.py
run the following command:
```bash
python main.py 
```

Limitations:
- Not a Replacement for Professional Diagnosis: Diagno is a tool to assist users and is not a substitute for medical advice from licensed healthcare professionals.
- Langauge support: Currently only support input text in english only.
- Complex Cases: May struggle with rare diseases or symptoms not well-represented in the training data.
- Loading time: While model predict the user input instantly, UI take a fair amount of time to load.
