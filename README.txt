Diagno: Medical Diagnostic Bot


Overview:
Diagno is an advanced machine learning model designed to analyze user-inputted symptoms in natural language (RNN) and predict the top 4 potential diseases based on the similarity. 

Features:
- Natural Language Input: Accepts free-text symptom descriptions from users.
- Top 4 Disease Predictions with descriptions: Outputs the most likely diseases based on the input, ranked by percentages of relevance. Also descriptions such as general description, symptom, and treatment for each disease.
- Percentage Similarity Scores: Provides a score for each predicted disease.

How It Works:
- The user enters their symptoms as text.
- Diagno processes the input using natural language processing techniques to extract and interpret symptoms.
- The model use RNN to matches the extracted symptoms against a trained disease database.
- Diagno returns the top 4 potential diseases and their corresponding similarity percentages.
- Diagno also show the general descriptions, symptom, and treatment for each disease.

To use Diagno, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- python
- tensorflow
- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- tkinter
- json
- pickle
- re
- subprocess
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- textwrap
- pathlib

To run Diagno (model_production), these are the additional prerequisites:
- sklearn
- collections
- time
- joblib

Steps to run (UI):
- Download all the file inside the folder.
- Change directory to diagno_final folder path in your computer (open terminal in visual studio code and type cd PATH/TO/DIAGNO_FINAL).
- Install all the prerequisites and dependencies.
- Run main.py

Limitations:
- Not a Replacement for Professional Diagnosis: Diagno is a tool to assist users and is not a substitute for medical advice from licensed healthcare professionals.
- Langauge support: Currently only support input text in english only.
- Complex Cases: May struggle with rare diseases or symptoms not well-represented in the training data.
- Loading time: While model predict the user input instantly, UI take a fair amount of time to load.
